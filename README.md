The **Focus on Today** :smiley:app is a simple yet effective productivity tool developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This app allows users to set up to three main goals for the day and track their progress as they complete each one. 
Hereâ€™s a quick overview of its functionality and design:

**Features:**

:point_right:**Three Daily Goals:** Users can add up to three primary goals for the day. 
Each goal entry box is simple and intuitive, allowing users to focus on what matters most.

:point_right:**Task Completion Tracking:** As each goal is marked complete, the app updates the status in real-time, giving users 
a visual indicator of their daily progress.

:point_right:**Dynamic Progress Bar:** A progress bar at the top of the screen fills as each task is completed, 
visually motivating users to reach their goals. The bar fills by increments of 33.33% as each of the three goals is checked off.

:point_right:**Clean UI/UX:** Styled with CSS for a minimal and distraction-free interface, the app uses soft colors and easy-to-read fonts, 
making it visually pleasing and simple to use.

**Workflow:**

:point_right:**Adding Tasks:** Users add goals by typing in each of the three designated fields.

:point_right:**Checking Off Goals:** Once a goal is completed, users can check it off, which triggers the progress bar to increment.

:point_right:**Completion Check:** When all three goals are completed, the progress bar reaches 100%, signifying that the user has successfully 
completed their tasks for the day.
